## About

Specialized in resilient, distributed systems that handle petabyte-scale data ingestion. I manage mission-critical infrastructure for global organizations where high availability is the baseline requirement.

- Distributed Systems & Disaster Recovery: Designing solutions to ensure business continuity across complex multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform).

- Polyglot Engineering: Building internal tools and automation in Go and Python to eliminate manual operational toil.

- Global Collaboration: Extensive experience coordinating with engineering teams across international time zones.

I am focused on improving Developer Experience through AI. By leveraging AI agents to automate toil, I aim to reduce the cognitive load of infrastructure management - empowering engineering teams to ship faster and more safely.
